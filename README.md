CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL, featuring a responsive design that ensures compatibility

ability to update the timetable displayed on the webpage without any coding knowledge, using 
CSV files.

The application offers a user-friendly interface that allows for data modification without 
the need for coding skills, supports importing large datasets through CSV files, and provides 
options for seamless data deletion. LAB FINDER is designed with robust security features to 
ensure that user data is protected and interactions remain secure. By simplifying lab task 
management, prioritizing data security, the project enhances productivity, making lab sessions 
more organized, efficient, and accessible for all user
